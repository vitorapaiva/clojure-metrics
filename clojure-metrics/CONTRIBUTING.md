# Contributing to Clojure Metrics

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Clojure Metrics! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) 2.0 or higher
- Java 8 or higher
- Git

### Setting up the development environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/clojure-metrics.git
   cd clojure-metrics
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   lein deps
   ```
4. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   lein test
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Add tests** for new functionality

4. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   lein test
   ```

5. **Check code formatting** (if cljfmt is configured):
   ```bash
   lein cljfmt check
   ```

6. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -am "Add descriptive commit message"
   ```

7. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

8. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring

## üìù Coding Standards

### Clojure Style Guidelines
- Follow [Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide)
- Use meaningful function and variable names
- Write docstrings for public functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer pure functions when possible

### Code Organization
- Place new metrics in the appropriate `logic/` namespace
- Add controller logic to `controller/` namespace
- Keep tests organized in parallel structure under `test/`

### Documentation
- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Update README.md for new features
- Add entries to CHANGELOG.md

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
lein test

# Run specific test namespace
lein test clojure-metrics.unit.logic.halstead-test

# Run specific test
lein test :only clojure-metrics.unit.logic.halstead-test/test-count-halstead
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Add integration tests for end-to-end functionality
- Aim for high test coverage

### Test Structure
```clojure
(deftest test-descriptive-name
  (testing "What this test validates"
    (is (= expected-result (function-under-test input))
        "Descriptive error message")))
```

## üìã Types of Contributions

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Include reproduction steps
- Add tests that would have caught the bug
- Keep fixes focused and minimal

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Adding New Metrics
1. Create the metric calculation logic in `src/clojure_metrics/logic/`
2. Add integration in the file analyzer
3. Update JSON output schema
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation

#### Example: Adding a new metric
```clojure
(ns clojure-metrics.logic.new-metric
  "Description of the new metric and its purpose.")

(defn calculate-new-metric
  "Calculate the new metric for the given AST data.
   
   Parameters:
   - ast-data: clj-kondo analysis output
   
   Returns:
   - Map with metric results"
  [ast-data]
  ;; Implementation here
  )
```

### üìö Documentation
- Fix typos and grammatical errors
- Improve clarity of existing documentation
- Add examples and use cases
- Translate documentation (if applicable)

### üîß Infrastructure
- CI/CD improvements
- Build process enhancements
- Development tooling
- Performance optimizations
