# Clojure Metrics

Static analysis tool for Clojure code based on clj-kondo, similar to PHPMetrics. Calculates important code quality metrics to help with development and maintenance of Clojure projects.

## Calculated Metrics

### 1. Halstead Complexity Measures
- **n1**: Number of unique operators
- **n2**: Number of unique operands  
- **N1**: Total number of operators
- **N2**: Total number of operands
- **Vocabulary (n)**: n1 + n2
- **Length (N)**: N1 + N2
- **Volume**: N * logâ‚‚(n)
- **Difficulty**: (n1/2) * (N2/n2)
- **Effort**: Difficulty * Volume

### 2. Cyclomatic Complexity
Measures the number of linearly independent paths through the code. Counts decision points such as:
- Conditionals: `if`, `when`, `cond`, `case`
- Loops: `loop`, `while`, `doseq`, `for`
- Exception handling: `try/catch`
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`

### 3. Maintainability Index
Composite metric that indicates how easy it is to maintain the code:
- **MI = 171 - 5.2 * ln(Halstead Volume) - 0.23 * (Cyclomatic Complexity) - 16.2 * ln(Lines of Code)**
- Includes bonus based on comment density
- Scale from 0-100 (higher is better)

### 4. Lines of Code (LoC)
- **Total lines**: All lines in the file
- **Physical lines**: Non-empty lines
- **Logical lines**: Lines with actual code (excluding comments)
- **Comment lines**: Lines containing only comments
- **Comment density**: Percentage of lines with comments

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd clojure-metrics
```

## Usage

### Analyze a directory:
```bash
lein run -- -p src/
```

### Show help:
```bash
lein run -- -h
```

The tool analyzes all `.clj` files in the specified directory recursively and outputs metrics in JSON format to stdout.

## JSON Output Format

The tool outputs a comprehensive JSON structure with both system-wide summary and individual file metrics:

## Sample Output

Here's an example analyzing a single Clojure file:

```json
[
  {
    "file": "test/clojure_metrics/resources/example.clj",
    "length": {
      "cloc": 49,
      "loc": 46,
      "lloc": 42
    },
    "halstead": {
      "n1": 15,
      "n2": 20,
      "N1": 45,
      "N2": 38,
      "vocabulary": 35,
      "length": 83,
      "volume": 425.2,
      "difficulty": 14.25,
      "effort": 6059.1
    },
    "cyclomatic-complexity": 8,
    "maintainability": {
      "index": 73.5,
      "classification": "high",
      "recommendations": ["Well-maintained code", "Keep current good practices"]
    }
  }
]
```

## Metrics Interpretation

### Cyclomatic Complexity
- **1-10**: Simple, low risk
- **11-20**: Moderate, medium risk
- **21-50**: Complex, high risk
- **>50**: Very complex, very high risk

### Maintainability Index
- **85-100**: Very high maintainability
- **70-85**: High maintainability
- **50-70**: Moderate maintainability
- **25-50**: Low maintainability
- **0-25**: Very low maintainability
