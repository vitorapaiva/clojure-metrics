# Introduction to Clojure Metrics

Clojure Metrics is a comprehensive static analysis tool designed to help developers understand and improve the quality of their Clojure code. Inspired by tools like PHPMetrics, it provides detailed insights into code complexity, maintainability, and overall quality through various established metrics.

## Why Use Clojure Metrics?

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Objective measurements** of code complexity and maintainability
- **Early detection** of potentially problematic code areas
- **Consistent evaluation** across different projects and teams

### Development Process Integration
- **JSON output** for easy integration with CI/CD pipelines
- **Command-line interface** for automated analysis workflows
- **Detailed reports** for code review processes

### Educational Value
- **Learn about code quality** through concrete metrics
- **Understand complexity patterns** in your codebase
- **Track improvements** over time

## Core Concepts

### Static Analysis
Clojure Metrics performs static analysis, meaning it examines your code without executing it. This approach provides:
- **Fast analysis** of large codebases
- **Safe examination** without side effects
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all code paths

### Metric Categories

#### Complexity Metrics
- **Halstead Complexity**: Measures based on operators and operands
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Control flow complexity analysis

#### Size Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: Various counting methods (total, logical, physical)
- **Comment Density**: Documentation coverage analysis

#### Quality Metrics
- **Maintainability Index**: Composite quality score
- **Structural Analysis**: Function and dependency counting

## Getting Started

1. **Install** Clojure Metrics in your project
2. **Run analysis** on your source code
3. **Review results** in the JSON output
4. **Integrate** into your development workflow

For detailed usage instructions, see the main [README](../README.md).

## Understanding the Output

Clojure Metrics provides two levels of analysis:

### System Summary
- Aggregated metrics across all analyzed files
- Overall project health indicators
- Average complexity measurements

### Individual File Analysis
- Detailed metrics for each source file
- Function-level complexity information
- Specific recommendations for improvement

## Best Practices

### Regular Analysis
- Run metrics analysis as part of your CI/CD pipeline
- Track metric trends over time
- Set quality gates based on complexity thresholds

### Interpretation Guidelines
- Use metrics as indicators, not absolute judgments
- Consider context when evaluating results
- Focus on patterns and trends rather than individual numbers

### Improvement Strategies
- Refactor high-complexity functions
- Improve comment density in complex areas
- Break down large functions into smaller, focused units
